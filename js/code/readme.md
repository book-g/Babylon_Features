| Includes elements like storylines, rewards, and achievements to motivate players. | Often lacks traditional gaming elements; the primary goal is skill-building or realistic replication. |

---

### **2. Accuracy vs. Creative Freedom**

| **Realistic Game**                      | **Simulator**                                                                                     |
